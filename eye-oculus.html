      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>The Eye Oculus project aimed to provide a low-cost assistive device for people with visual impairments. Responsibilities included concept sketches, user testing sessions, and prototype iterations based on feedback. The final prototype was a handheld device with tactile feedback from three small vibration motors based on the sensor readings from three LIDAR sensors facing forward, up and down. The design was completely wireless including a charging port and on/off button. The sensing and actuation logic was implemented in an Arduino Nano microcontroller and the device was fully functional.</p>
